# SmashTracker

This application is currently under development.

This was originally a C# app, but I'm taking another crack at it using Elixir and creating a leaner version. I plan to only support Melee for now, but will build the application to be expandable later, to not only other Smash Bros. games, but other fighting games as well, such as Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat.

The backend will be Elixir, and Angular will serve the front-end of it. The ideal will be to serve this inside Electron and make it a desktop application, but that'll be a later update.

For posterity and inspection, I'm leaving the old C# code in the repository for now.
