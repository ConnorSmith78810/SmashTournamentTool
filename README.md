# SmashTracker

This application is currently under development

This is a desktop application written to aid in the running of tournaments for Super Smash Bros. The final product will have support for all games in the series. This tool has features such as tracking rating automatically, using my implementation of Microsoft's TrueSkill algorithm, tournament creation and management tools using Challonge.com's API, and even match scheduling tools.
