# SmashTracker

This code is obsolete.

This was the old version of my SmashTracker application. I was going to use WPF and create the whole thing in C#, but I've now changed over to creating this in Vue using Electron. For the current version of this application, see (SmashTracker)[https://github.com/css13c/SmashTracker].
